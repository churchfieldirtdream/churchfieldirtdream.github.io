THE SOTHOTH GAZE - pt. 1</br>
</br>
<i>“Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth.”
-H.P. Lovecraft</i></br>
</br>
The term for our thesis was coined by Lashbrook, him being a huge Lovecraft nerd. As he explained to me, Yog-Sothoth is a creature in Lovecraft’s books which is responsible for guarding the gate to another dimension or something along those lines.</br>
Anyway, Lashbrook, Ruwet and I got this idea from overhearing a group of hippies at a bar. They were talking about their LSD trips and how they went to another dimension during these trips. I found it interesting as I’ve never taken any psychoactive substances except for medication here and there. </br>
I mention to Lash and Ruwet how this subject is kind of intriguing and Ruwet goes on a tangent about some top secret CIA project where they experiment with LSD and its effects on the human brain. Like top-top secret.
Brainwashing, torture, etc.</br>
As we carried on drinking, we somehow kept circling back to this secret project Ruwet mentioned but she wouldn’t reveal any more. After pestering her for more info, she invited us to her place.</br>
Lash and I lived a couple of blocks away from each other in Georgetown while Ruwet was in a house in Eckington, a fair distance by foot.
We were so interested in this project, the 2 hour walk back to Georgetown wasn’t an issue. And we were drunk.</br></br>
We got inside Ruwet’s house and I was immediately taken aback.</br> Every possible desk or desk-like surface was covered in stacks and stacks of paper. Documents strewn all around her home. Lash and I sat on the couch in her living room and she started rummaging through the papers on her coffee table until she finally found a thick stack barely held together by a single paperclip. </br></br>
“MK ULTRA, THE CIA’S PROGRAM OF RESEARCH IN BEHAVIORAL MODIFICATION”</br></br>
I remember thinking “Oh, so she wasn’t just drunkenly rambling. It’s real.”</br>
We flipped through the pages with a child-like excitement. 
It detailed brainwashing experiments, POW torture methods, forcing copious amounts of LSD on test subjects. It was all fascinating.</br>
And then we got to page 121.</br>
Every single hair on my skin stood up. A cold wave stuck itself into the core of my soul.
There it was, page 121, clear as day. A large footnote at the bottom of the page</br>
</br>
<i>“The most tragic result of the testing of LSD by the CIA was the death of Dr. Frank Olson, a civilian employee of the Army, who died on November 27, 1953.”</i></br>
</br>
Dr. Olson? What are the chances? One letter off. This little coincidence is odd but not spine-chillingly odd. No, the part which made me utterly terrified was a little unassuming sentence right below.</br>
</br>
<i>“The drug had been placed in the bottle by a CIA officer, Dr. Robert Lashbrook, as part of an experiment he and Dr. Sidney Gottlieb performed at a meeting of Army and CIA scientists.”</i>
</br></br>
Robert Lashbrook? The very same Robert Lashbrook sitting beside me? The one hunched over me, reading this same paper? The one who’s warm breath I can feel on my neck? The Robert Lashbrook I’ve known since we got paired in biochemistry?
Can’t be. My eyes kept jumping from his name to mine on the paper. Slowly, I turned my head towards him only to see his expression matching mine. An expression of shock and terror, his eyes glued to the document.
