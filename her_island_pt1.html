“The nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh... was built in measureless eons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars.”</br>
-H.P. Lovecraft
</i></br></br>
 Night. Stars shine eerily bright. Moonlight glistens over a rocky shore. Birds fly in place, fighting the howling wind. A bonfire lights up. A distant chant echoes through the foggy night.</br></br>
<i>“Alnawm ya Darsa”</i></br>
The island is empty, soulless. Yet it speaks.</br>
<i>“Alnawm ya Darsa”</i></br>
A loud, unbearable rumbling.</br>
<i>“Alnawm ya Darsa”</i></br>
The ocean’s waves strike the island with increasing intensity, chipping away at its shoreline.</br>
<i>“Alnawm ya Darsa”</i></br>
The chant grows louder, surrounding the island, it comes from each and every direction.</br>
<i>“Alnawm ya Darsa”</i></br>
The ground opens to reveal an eye spanning the entirety of the island. It stares at the sky.</br>
<i>“Alnawm ya Da-"</i></br></br>

She wakes up. Fighting the piles of paper in her bedroom, she steps down to the kitchen. Stacks of messy, stained documents scattered all over the house will, yet again, serve as saucers for her cup of morning coffee.</br></br>

I awoke in a cloud of ice. A static breeze surrounding my entire body, shivers traveling across my torso, goosebumps feeling as sharp as a well-honed blade.</br></br>

......</br></br>

“Good morning, Ruwet” Olsen utters, his speech hanging between a yawn and comprehensible words.</br>
“Morning, guys”, she plops her notebook on the rotting wood table.</br></br>

I cannot make chatter today. How can I look my colleagues in the eye, knowing the dream I had last night, the dream I am hiding from them. The dream which might shake our research to its core. That island… a feeling lingers inside me, telling me it was real.
I drew a sketch of it. It consisted of two parts, like the closed lids of an eye. Sleeping.</br>
“...as for Lashbrook and Olsen, you two get started on the nitrous cellular bonding”. 
I snap out of my daze, look at her and nod. </br>Her eyes...</br>
“Let’s get to the chem lab, Lash”, Olsen says, tapping my shoulder.
He noticed I’m in distress. He’s the only one that does. Nobody else can tell between my usual demeanor and this state of unrest.</br></br>

........</br></br>

I sit on my couch, lost in thought. The chanting in my dream, it sounded like an existing language. I could make out three words, the third one definitely being Dr. Ruwett’s 
first name - Darsah. The first sounded like <i>"all-na-whim"</i>, its annunciation reminding me of arabic. Wait. The island, the bonfire, the arabic, the chanting, the gigantic horror sprawling from the sea? I burst out laughing. </br></br>
Did I simply conjure an excerpt from Lovecraft’s <i>Call Of Cthulhu</i>?
Did I really get so startled by what was essentially a retelling of the stories I read before bed? I’m getting lost in fantasies written almost a century ago. Ink on paper. That’s what had me on the verge of a panic attack all day? Hilarious, I thought, as a cloud of ice drifted across my torso.</br></br>
