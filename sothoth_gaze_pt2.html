...Lott stared at me with a matching intensity. The names on this document…they cannot be coincidental. Reading about these events feels like recalling a long-forgotten dream.</br>
I averted my gaze onto Dr. Ruwet. She stood above us, arms crossed, the coffee table separating her from the couch upon which we sat. Her face was motionless, as a parent deciding which punishment is appropriate for their misbehaving child. And like a child I felt.
Like a child coming face to face with a hard truth, unable to fully comprehend it.
</br></br>
Tens of thousands of thoughts raced in my consciousness, forming a radio static.

A single thought fought its way out and rose to the surface:</br> “I died here.”
</br></br>
My esophagus was shut tight. I couldn’t breathe. I died here. On this very couch. A memory not so vivid, yet so real. Like a hazy dream. A sharp sensation on the back of my skull, a lack of air, a humid smell, a gurgling sound, a metal door slamming shut. Scraping. </br>Scratching. Scraping. Scratching.</br>
Scraping…s…cratchng…</br>

Ruwet, Olsen and myself grabbed a drink at the Alibi Room. During my drunken stumble home, I came up with an exciting idea which I think may be worth pursuing.</br>
I will have to do some research before presenting this idea to my colleagues. For now, a tall glass of water and a good night's sleep is of utmost importance.
