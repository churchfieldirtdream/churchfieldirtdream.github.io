I am fearful for my confidant’s life. Lott’s description of ROT sounds hellish, demonic, a torturous purgatory of an unfathomable nature. <br />
A primeval, morose hellscape with no exit, no escape route other than the ambivalent chance of waking up. I am assembling an urgent request directed at The Agency, asking to cease these perverse voyages at once. I may be a man of science but I am a man of morals first and foremost. My dear Lott… my heart could not bear witness to your malady for it would shatter like a lightbulb under immense electrical current.
<br />
<br />
ADDENDUM<br />
<br />
It’s been several hours since my previous entry, during which I’ve regrettably written and sent the request form. My sentimentality has worn off and my thoughts are stable. I might value Olsen as a colleague and a like-minded individual but I must remind myself that our pursuit of knowledge can not be tainted by these emotional outbursts. Our work in Topeka is far too important, I’m sure Dr. Olsen is aware of this. I am writing another letter, informing The Agency of my error. The tests will continue.

&block;&block;&block; went into &block;&block; last night. Described the &block;&block;, the &block;&block; and the &block;&block;. His &block;&block; was &block;&block;, his &block;&block;&block; was &block;&block;&block;&block; and his &block;&block;&block; was a &block;&block;&block; - most likely the &block;&block;&block;&block;&block;&block; up the road from our lab. Interesting stuff.<br />
<br />
I’ve read into these symbols and my theory is as follows:<br />
<br />
&block;&block;&block;’s &block;&block; being &block;&block;&block; is telling of his &block;&block; state. His brain is most likely incapable of producing anything other than &block;&block;&block; because it’s all &block;&block;&block; feeds into it.<br />
<br />
His &block;&block; was &block;&block;&block;&block;, likely a reflection of an &block;&block;&block; nature, his relationships with people may all be forced either by circumstance (such as work) or by a parasitic gain, maintaining them purely for his own benefit. <br />
<br />
His &block;&block;&block;&block; being a &block;&block;&block; points to a &block;&block;&block; nature, or a need for one. He may be aware of the scale of these experiments, linking them to a &block;&block;&block;-&block;&block; presence. Knowing the &block;&block;&block;&block;&block; &block;&block;&block;&block; is close-by, he most likely recalled the most obvious symbol for &block;&block;.<br />
<br />
&block;&block;&block;&block; also mentions an &block;&block; above him. It’s odd that it appeared during his first &block;&block;&block;, but may be a sign we’re on the right track.<br />
<br />
He recalls neither a &block;&block;&block; nor a &block;&block;&block; sensation.<br />
<br />
Summary: excellent results after only one session, much better than expected. Will continue with testing.

Just had &block;&block;&block; tested on myself for the first time. It was odd to say the least. Falling asleep was difficult because of the stress. &block;&block; assured me I wouldn't feel anything but man did it hurt like a bitch. I felt the &block;&block;&block;&block; going in. Hoping the &block;&block; will heal.<br />
<br />
Anyway, at first it was just run-of-the-mill sleep, just dark and whatever. Nothing happening, no dream, nothing. And then it happened. I awoke &block;&block;&block;&block;&block;&block;&block;&block;&block; a vast landscape of &block;&block;&block;. It was terrifying to say the least. The dirt beneath my feet felt &block;&block;&block;&block;. &block;&block;&block;&block;&block;. I had at least 6 more hours of sleep so I decided to start walking in one direction.
Walking in &block;&block; is weird, doesn't feel like you're moving at all. There is no source of light to cast shadows, no objects to see, nothing to tell your mind that you’re moving. Yet I walked.<br />
<br /> After what felt like approx. 10 minutes, a &block;&block;&block;&block; slowly appeared in the fog. A &block;&block;! I ran towards it for another ~10 minutes until it was about 100 meters from me. It was a &block;&block;&block;. An &block;&block;, &block;&block;, run down &block;&block;&block;. A simple design, a door on the left hand side of the front of the &block;&block;&block;, a &block;&block;&block;&block; &block;&block;&block;&block;&block; window next to the door. Triangular roofing with a &block;&block;&block; at the very top. The light from inside was warm and flickering, like a candle flame. Finally, I approached the &block;&block;&block; only to discover the &block;&block; was completely &block;&block;, like it was &block;&block;&block;&block;&block;&block;&block;&block;. There was no &block;&block;&block;, the &block;&block;&block; on the door had no &block;&block;&block; - just like &block;&block;&block;, it was like a smooth, flat &block;&block;&block;&block;&block;. <br />
<br />For the first time since arriving in this place, I heard a sound. It was coming from inside the &block;&block;&block;. Muffled and quiet, it sounded like &block;&block;&block;&block; but I couldn't &block;&block;&block;&block; &block;&block;&block; &block;. I put my ear to the &block;&block; in an attempt to hear better but the sound stopped as soon as I did. And then, a loud &block;&block; from the other side of the &block;&block;, right where my ear was placed. Something &block;&block; the &block;&block; on the other side. I recoiled in fear and looked around me. Behind me and all around the &block;&block; was a &block;&block;&block;&block;. Underneath my feet, &block;&block;&block;&block;&block;. Past the &block;&block;, an &block;&block;&block; with unaligned &block;&block; markings. &block;&block;&block;. A &block;&block;&block;. Another sound - &block;&block; and &block;&block;&block;&block; on &block;&block;&block;, like dragging a heavy &block;&block;&block; along the &block;&block;&block;&block; in short bursts. The sound started behind the &block;&block; and kept going down the &block;&block;&block; until it disappeared in the &block;&block;. I looked up at the &block;&block;&block; sky only to see an &block;&block; staring back at me. As soon as I did, I woke up.
